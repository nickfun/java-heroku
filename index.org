* Java/Heroku

This project is a testbed to explore writing Java Webapps and hosting them on Heroku.

[[http://aqueous-refuge-9456.herokuapp.com/][It is currently hosted on Heroku]], but it's on the free plan. That means the first request might take a while
as they will put my app to sleep if it gets no traffic for a while.

* Tech

I started by following the Heroku Java quickstart guide. That explains how to write a simple Java
application that uses Jetty to handle http traffic. I then wrote a few servlets to experiment with.
The whole thing is built and managed by Maven. It's been great so far!
