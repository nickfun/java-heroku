* Java-Heroku
** Goals
- simple playground for learning java webapps
- keep it simple, no frameworks, raw java
- learn about importing libraries using Maven
- avoid IDEs for now, just using Emacs over SSH

** In Progress
- connect to database, run a query, return formatted results
- JSON output
- A simple backend like my `games` PHP app
- How do I handle connections?
- I need to add a DB to my heroku account or I cant deploy it again
- determine if it is running on heroku & not connect to database?
