* Java-Heroku
** Goals
- simple playground for learning java webapps
- keep it simple, no frameworks, raw java
- learn about importing libraries using Maven
- avoid IDEs for now, just using Emacs over SSH

** In Progress
- connect to database, run a query, return formatted results
- JSON output
- A simple backend like my `games` PHP app
- How do I handle connections?
- I need to add a DB to my heroku account or I cant deploy it again
- determine if it is running on heroku & not connect to database?

** Understand:
- Does using servlets mean I am using JavaEE?
- Is there a http processing library so I can just manage a TCP connection myself?
- How can I make a class that handels multiple endpoints? It seems with servlets I can only define doGet("/path") per class.
- *WHY* does foreman not shutdown my application correctly? The port does not get released when I Ctrl-C the foreman process. FRUSTRATING! It worked before, when did I upgrade?
